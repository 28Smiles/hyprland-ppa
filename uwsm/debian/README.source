Universal Wayland Session Manager
--------------

Wraps standalone Wayland compositors into a set of Systemd units on the fly. This provides robust session management including environment, XDG autostart support, bi-directional binding with login session, and clean shutdown.

For compositors this is an opportunity to offload Systemd integration and session/XDG autostart management in Systemd-managed environments.
