To obtain the upstream tarball, run origtargz from the devscripts package.
This repacks the tarball to exclude a vendored copy of the nanosvg library.

The upstream tarball generated by codeberg.org uses fuzzel/ as the prefix.
git-buildpackage uses fuzzel-VERSION/ which results in a different tarball.
