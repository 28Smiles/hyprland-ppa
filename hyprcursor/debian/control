 hyprcursor1 (= ${binary:Version}),

Description: The hyprland cursor format, library and utilities.
 XCursor sucks, and we still use it today.
 - Scaling of XCursors is horrible
 - XCursor does not support vector cursors
 - XCursor is ridiculously space-inefficient
 Hyprcursor fixes all three. It's an efficient cursor theme format that doesn't suck as much.
 This package includes the build-headers for using hyprlang in your own project.
